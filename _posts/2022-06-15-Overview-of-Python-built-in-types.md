I am trying to further my Python skills whenever I have the time. Recently, I was refreshing my knowledge as to the data types that are built in to the Python interpreter.

Amongst other online resources, I consulted the <a class="postanchor" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html" target="_blank">official Python documentation</a>.

However, I also searched for a <i>schematic</i> overview of types. Although there are quite a few of these schematics, I found none of them satisfactory to my needs.

Therefore I decided to create my own overview, which I want to publish here. It is based on the page that I just referenced with the hyperlink. So it's based on the source instead of on secondary literature.

Please note that this overview is by no means complete. Although I believe that the types that are the most relevant to test automation are in there, I will expand the drawing in the future and update this page with it.

In the meanwhile, I think the overview in it's current form can be helpful.

If you find errors in this schema, please let me know in a comment below. Once more: the overview is not (yet) complete. It is a work in progress.
