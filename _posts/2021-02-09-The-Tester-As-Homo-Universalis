As testers we are expected to act as some sort of homo universalis. A species of humankind that is generally deemed to be extinct.

There is no other role within the software development domain, that carries with it such a wealth of expectations. Especially, since these expectations exist on so many different planes.

For starters, we need to be well versed within the traditional testing realm (think TMap/ISTQB), which in and onto itself requires years of study and experience to fully master. Not only in terms of involved techniques, processes and patterns, but also in terms of all sorts of tools: test management tools, test design tools, defect management tools, risk analysis tools, etc. All of this is intellectually very challenging and demanding.

But nowadays we need to be versatile test automation engineers as well.

The latter requires us to master, for instance, multiple test automation languages (Java, Python, Javascript and others), database related skills (e.g. multiple DBMS's, SQL) and test APIs (e.g. Selenium, Cypress). Additionally, we need to be adept at all sorts of technical interfaces (e.g. HTTP, REST, SOAP, database-APIs, XPath) and a plethora of various types of automation tools, such as generic test automation tools, ATTD/BDD/TDD tools and all kinds of specialized technical test tools: Robot Framework. Fitnesse, Cucumber, JBehave, POSTMAN, REST-assured, Soap-UI, cURL, HP UFT, Tricentis Tosca, etc., etc., etc.

Not only that, increasingly we are expected to be well versed when it comes to CI/CD, both in terms of designing, implementing or integrating with pipelines and in terms of the relevant tools. We are getting more and more involved in the practices, patterns, tools and techniques surrounding trends such as Devops and Cloud Native Computing. For instance, we need to know, understand and have experience with regard to containerization and the orchestration thereof. Whether it be AWS, Azure, Jenkins, Bamboo, Docker or Kubernetes: we need to be able to utilize all of them now or at some point in the near future.

On top of all of that, I am then supposed to happily perform the role of Scrum Master if need be. :-)

So, what is asked of us, testers, is that we are at once generalists and specialists across the full spectrum of involved areas.

Like a true homo universalis.

We euphemistically call that T-shaped. But if you start thinking about it, you soon reach the conclusion that it is actually impossible to be an effective and valuable generalist with regard to traditional testing, test automation or CI/CD. Not only is it virtually impossible, but when I critically evaluate the expectations and demands (of management and fellow team members alike) regarding my knowledge and skills as a 'tester', then it is evident that they need me to be an expert in traditional testing, test automation and CI/CD.

Ever since I started in the business as a junior tester (some twenty-odd years ago), I have studied my b**t of. And gladly so: I like learning and growing! Still do.

Having said that, every so often I feel that it is not only becoming increasingly difficult to maintain this status of homo universalis, but that it is becoming downright impossible to do so. Simply because of the insane rate at which new developments follow up on each other, in combination with the (rather massive) diversification of the engineering fields that these developments take place in.

And it is definitely not just me. I see my fellow testers struggle with this every day. They are often unwittingly pressurized into their so-called 'T-shaped' roles. At the same time they feel overwhelmed by them, because of the expected breadth and depth of their expertise.

I feel that we need to debate this situation.

The last days of the homo universalis are finally upon us.
