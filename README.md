# Welcome

At long last I have created my own blog space. Been thinking about that for ages.

That's right, this site exists primarily to host blog posts. Posts related to software testing and, in particular, test automation. Some of them will be text, others video.

Topics may include:

<ul>
  <li>Test automation strategy.</li>
  <li>Test automation architecture and design.</li>
  <li>Test automation tools.</li>
  <li>Test automation interfaces.</li>
  <li>Et alia.</li>
</ul>

I had been publishing posts before, always using the blog space of the organization I worked for at that time. So those posts are kinda scattered around. By creating this space, I hope to keep things more tidy.

To achieve this I used <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github pages</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>.

I have yet to complete several parts of this site, such as the 'Bio' and 'Contact' sections. But the most important part of the site is in place, namely the blog section:

<ul>
  <li>See <a href="https://michaelhallik.github.io/blog/">posts by date</a>.</li>
  <li>Or see <a href="https://michaelhallik.github.io/_pages/blogarchive">posts by topic</a>.</li>
</ul>

Take a look around and and, if you feel like it, leave me a comment. Tell me what you think and what you would like to read about.
