Michael has been a software tester since 2000, in various roles.

His first exposure to Robot Framework (and test automation) came as early as 2011. It was love at first sight. Since then he has utilized its unmatched power and versatility within such disparate domains as banking, real estate, insurance and the worlds of CMS, CDP and EDP systems. Just as diverse have been the interfaces that had to be automated against. But regardless whether it were web GUIs, SOAP services, database APIs, REST-APIs, proprietary JAVA APIs, MQ or ILE RPG based mainframe systems: RF and its rich ecosystem always came to the rescue.

Michael has written extensively about various aspects of working with Robot Framework, in the form of a series of blog posts. He has also created his own series of Robot Framework related workshops, around themes such as the Remote Library Interface, the testing of RESTful JSON APIs or the testing of SOAP services.
